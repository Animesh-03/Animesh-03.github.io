                <p>
                    We follow the actions of an alien slime-like creature that drops from the asteroid a few hours before the asteroid crashes onto the Earth.
                    In the due course of the story we also see how the myth about legendary creatures like a Griffon and Dragon came about as well as some more common species like Algae.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h1 class="text-2xl mb-2">Description</h1>
                <p>
                    The slime lands on the river bank on the Earth where a vast variety of wildlife thrives with its unique food chain.
                    The slime has a tendency to counsume whatever it finds. Its first prey is a small plant which grows on the river bank with dense vines hanging from it.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    When the slime consumes the plant, the vines start growing on the slime. While wandering around for its next prey it falls into the river and consumes the water in the river
                    which results in an increase in the size of vines as well as the slime itself. It gained the ability to synthesize energy by combining the abilities of theplant and the water along
                    with the Sunlight. This resulted in the formation of algae which was left as a trail in its path.
                </p>
                <br/>   
                <p>
                    It finds an Eagle perched on top of a tree which it climbs using the vines without alarming the Eagle and jumps at it and consumes it in one swift motion. The slime has now evolved
                    gaining an exoskeleton for the first time as well as the wings of the Eagle which allows it to fly around in search of more prey.
                </p>
                <br/>    
                <p>
                    In its hunt it comes across a Lion which gets consumed and the slime now has 4 limbs as well as the face of the Lion but also the Eagle's wings.
                    Along with the face of the lion it also gained a Lion's pride and ego which makes it look for more challenging prey.
                    This creature is known as a Griffon inthe modern times. The slime grows larger with every prey it consumes and is now as big as a Dinosaur.
                </p>
                <br/>   
                <p>
                    The Griffon-Slime comes across a real Dinosaur in its flight and as per its instincts consumes it. The slime grows extremely large and now has tremendous strength that it gained from
                    the Dinosaur. This creature is known as a "Dragon" in the modern times.
                </p>
                <br/>    
                <p>
                    The Dragon-Slime continued on its search for prey but could not find anything challenging. It finally notices the Asteroid that is heading towards the Earth and flies towards it
                    using its mighty wings. The slime engulfs the asteroid completely and succeeds in consuming it but only for a short while. As it consumed the asteroid it gained its property of heat and magma
                    which the slime could not adapt to and starts falling from the sky while loosing its integrity at the same time and decays rapidly before it finally explodes.

                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    The slime gets torn into a billion pieces and falls on the Earth mixed with water in the form of rain. The slime that falls on a surface starts decaying immediately melting even mountains.
                    This decay leaves behind some parts behind completely unharmed. As the slime falls on dinosaurs and other creatures, the only thing that remains are carcasses.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    This incident lead to the extinction of Dinosaurs and the few who remained alive during the time spread the knowledge of the creatures that they witnessed.
                    The carcasses that were left are now displayed in the museums.
